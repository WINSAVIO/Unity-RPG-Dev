## 📖 About The Project

This project serves as a comprehensive study of RPG mechanics. It features a responsive combat system where the player can unlock various abilities through a skill tree, manage equipment via an inventory system, and fight enemies driven by intelligent AI.

### Key Technical Features
* **Finite State Machine (FSM):** Player and enemy behaviors (Idle, Move, Attack, Stun) are managed through a robust state machine pattern, ensuring clean and maintainable code.
* **Skill System:** A fully functional Unlockable Skill Tree that dynamically updates player abilities (e.g., Sword Throw, Dash, Ultimate).
* **Inventory & Stats:** Backend systems for managing items, equipment stats, and player attributes.
* **Parallax & VFX:** Polished visuals with parallax background layers and particle effects for combat impact.
